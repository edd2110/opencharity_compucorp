My approach was designing first a section-based model. Where each topic has its own section divided on divs. So, everything could be edited via block editing in drupal admin. 

If there's something I want to highlight would be the CSS model. Classified on general and specific elements plus css3 transitions and the scalability of the css stylesheet. GIving elements te abilities to be transferred or increased in number.
